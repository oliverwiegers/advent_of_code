# Advent Of Code

This year I finally managed to start [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
for the first time. In recent years I kind of forgot every year.

This repository will contain my solutions to the puzzles.

**Warning!** Naturally the code contains spoilers to the puzzles. If you havent
finished the puzzles and plan to you should come back later.

## Puzzles

### 2022

- [Day 01](./2022/day_01)


## Running

Paste your input for a given puzzle (you get your own on
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)) into a file named `input.txt` in
the root directory of the puzzel you want to solve and execute the `solve.py`.

For example:

```bash
# Get input and copy to clipboard

git clone https://github.com/oliverwiegers/advent_of_code.git
cd advent_of_code/2022/day_01/puzzle_01/

clippaste > input.txt
python3 solve.py
```

## Thanks

Huge thanks to @topaz for creating and maintaining Advent of Code :)
