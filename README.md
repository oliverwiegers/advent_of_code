# Advent Of Code

This year I finally managed to start [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
for the first time. In recent years I kind of forgot every year.

This repository will contain my solutions to the puzzles.

**Warning!** Naturally the code contains spoilers to the puzzles. If you havent
finished the puzzles and plan to you should come back later.
